<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Our project takes security seriously and we strive to ensure that all user data is kept safe. Here are some of the security measures we have implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All user passwords are encrypted using a one-way hashing algorithm to ensure that they cannot be easily compromised in the event of a data breach.</li>
  <li>We use Django's built-in authentication system to handle user login and logout, which provides a secure and reliable way to manage user sessions.</li>
  <li>We implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection to prevent malicious requests from being sent from other domains.</li>
  <li>We ensure that all user input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks.</li>
  <li>We use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the server and client to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
  <li>We employ various security best practices such as regular security audits, code reviews, and vulnerability testing to ensure that our project remains secure and up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
